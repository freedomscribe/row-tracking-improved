# ROW Tracking Application - Project Summary

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the enhanced ROW (Right-of-Way) Tracking application, built with modern web technologies and ready for production deployment on Vercel.

## What Has Been Built

The application has been completely rebuilt from the ground up with significant improvements over the original version. The new architecture leverages **Next.js 15** with the App Router, **TypeScript** for type safety, **PostgreSQL** with **Prisma ORM** for data management, and **Stripe** for subscription billing.

### Core Technologies

The technology stack includes **Next.js 15** as the React framework with server-side rendering and API routes, **TypeScript** for enhanced code quality and developer experience, **PostgreSQL** as the production-grade relational database, **Prisma** as the type-safe ORM with automatic migrations, **NextAuth.js** for authentication with multiple providers, **Stripe** for subscription management and payment processing, **Material-UI (MUI)** for beautiful and accessible UI components, **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching, **Leaflet** for interactive map visualization, and **Recharts** for analytics dashboards.

### Authentication System

The authentication system supports multiple sign-in methods including **Google OAuth** for one-click sign-in, **GitHub OAuth** as an optional provider, and traditional **email/password** authentication. All authentication is secured with **JWT tokens** and session management through NextAuth.js, with automatic session refresh and secure cookie handling.

### Subscription Tiers

The application offers four subscription tiers to meet different user needs. The **Free** tier provides 2 projects with 50 parcels per project, 1 user, and CSV export capability. The **Basic** tier at $29 per month includes 10 projects with 200 parcels per project, 3 users, 100 MB storage, and both PDF and CSV export options. The **Pro** tier at $99 per month offers unlimited projects and parcels, 10 users, 1 GB storage, advanced analytics, and API access. The **Enterprise** tier provides custom pricing with unlimited everything, dedicated support, custom features, SSO integration, and on-premise deployment options.

### Key Features Implemented

The project management system allows users to create and manage multiple ROW projects with comprehensive project details including name, description, location, and dates. Each project tracks status (Planning, Active, On Hold, Completed), provides statistics and progress tracking, and supports bulk operations.

The parcel tracking functionality includes detailed parcel information with owner details, legal descriptions, geometry data, and status tracking. Parcels can have five status states: Not Started, In Progress, Acquired, Condemned, and Relocated. Users can add notes and comments to each parcel, upload and manage documents, and track sequence and milepost information.

The interactive map feature uses Leaflet for visualization with color-coded parcel status, GeoJSON support for geometry data, drawing and editing tools, layer management, and the ability to export maps as images.

The analytics dashboard provides real-time project statistics, status distribution charts, progress tracking over time, county-based analysis, and custom date range filtering.

The export functionality generates line lists in CSV format with customizable fields, creates professional PDF reports with detailed or summary views, exports GeoJSON for GIS integration, and supports filtered exports by status or county.

The document management system enables file uploads with Vercel Blob storage, supports various file types including PDFs, images, and documents, provides preview functionality, and implements version control.

### Database Schema

The database uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables. The **users** table stores user accounts with email, password hash, name, role, and timestamps. The **accounts** table manages OAuth provider accounts with provider information and tokens. The **sessions** table handles user sessions with session tokens and expiry. The **subscriptions** table tracks subscription tiers, limits, Stripe integration, and status. The **projects** table contains project information including name, description, location, status, and dates. The **parcels** table stores parcel details with owner information, legal descriptions, geometry, status, and measurements. The **notes** table manages parcel notes with content, author, and timestamps. The **documents** table tracks uploaded files with URLs, types, and metadata.

### API Routes

The application provides comprehensive API endpoints. Authentication endpoints include `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` for NextAuth handlers, `/api/auth/register` for user registration, and `/api/auth/login` for credential-based login. Project endpoints include `/api/projects` for GET all projects and POST new project, `/api/projects/[id]` for GET, PATCH, and DELETE operations, `/api/projects/[id]/stats` for project statistics, and `/api/projects/[id]/export` for CSV/PDF export. Parcel endpoints include `/api/parcels` for GET all parcels with filtering and POST new parcel, and `/api/parcels/[id]` for GET, PATCH, and DELETE operations. Subscription endpoints include `/api/stripe/checkout` for creating checkout sessions and `/api/stripe/portal` for managing subscriptions. Webhook endpoints include `/api/webhooks/stripe` for Stripe event handling.

### Security Features

Security is implemented through multiple layers. Authentication uses JWT tokens with secure HTTP-only cookies and automatic session refresh. Authorization implements role-based access control with user and admin roles, and ownership verification for all resources. Data protection includes password hashing with bcrypt, SQL injection prevention through Prisma, XSS protection with React, and CSRF protection with NextAuth. API security features rate limiting by subscription tier, input validation with Zod schemas, error handling without information leakage, and HTTPS enforcement in production.

### UI/UX Design

The user interface features a responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The Material-UI components provide a professional and consistent look with a customizable theme using brand colors. The layout includes a dashboard with sidebar navigation, a header with user menu, and a main content area. Animations use Framer Motion for smooth transitions and loading states with skeletons. Accessibility features include ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader support.

## File Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure. The root directory contains configuration files including `package.json` for dependencies and scripts, `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration, `next.config.js` for Next.js settings, `tailwind.config.ts` for Tailwind CSS, `.env.example` for environment variables template, `.gitignore` for Git exclusions, `vercel.json` for Vercel deployment, and `README.md` for project documentation.

The `prisma/` directory contains `schema.prisma` for the database schema and `migrations/` for database migrations. The `public/` directory holds static assets including images and icons. The `src/` directory contains the main application code organized into several subdirectories.

The `src/app/` directory uses the Next.js App Router structure with `layout.tsx` as the root layout, `page.tsx` as the landing page, `globals.css` for global styles, `(auth)/` for authentication pages including login and register, `(dashboard)/` for protected dashboard pages including dashboard, projects, analytics, and settings, and `api/` for API routes including auth, projects, parcels, stripe, and webhooks.

The `src/components/` directory contains React components organized into `layout/` for Header and Sidebar, `ui/` for reusable UI components, `forms/` for form components, `maps/` for map-related components, and `charts/` for analytics charts.

The `src/lib/` directory holds utility functions and configurations including `auth.ts` for NextAuth configuration, `prisma.ts` for Prisma client, `stripe.ts` for Stripe utilities, `utils.ts` for helper functions, `validations.ts` for Zod schemas, and `exports.ts` for export utilities.

The `src/middleware.ts` file provides route protection and authentication checks.

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, you need a Vercel account at vercel.com, a GitHub repository with your code, a PostgreSQL database from Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Railway, Google OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console, a Stripe account with products configured, and optionally a custom domain.

### Quick Start

To get started quickly, follow these steps. First, push your code to GitHub by initializing a git repository, adding all files, committing with an initial message, and pushing to your GitHub repository. Next, create a database by choosing a provider (Vercel Postgres recommended), creating a new database instance, and copying the DATABASE_URL connection string.

Then set up OAuth providers. For Google, go to Google Cloud Console, create a new project, enable Google+ API, create OAuth 2.0 credentials, add authorized redirect URIs for your domain, and copy the Client ID and Client Secret. For GitHub (optional), go to GitHub Developer Settings, create a new OAuth App, set the callback URL, and copy the credentials.

Configure Stripe by switching to production mode, creating three products (Basic $29/mo, Pro $99/mo, Enterprise custom), copying the Price IDs, getting your API keys (publishable and secret), and setting up a webhook endpoint at your domain pointing to `/api/webhooks/stripe`.

Deploy to Vercel by going to vercel.com/new, importing your GitHub repository, adding all environment variables from the `.env.example` file, and clicking Deploy. After deployment, run database migrations using the Vercel CLI with `vercel env pull` and `npx prisma migrate deploy`.

Finally, test your deployment by visiting your site, trying Google OAuth login, creating a test project, subscribing to a plan using Stripe test card 4242 4242 4242 4242, and verifying all features work.

### Environment Variables

You need to set up several environment variables. For the database, set `DATABASE_URL` to your PostgreSQL connection string. For NextAuth, set `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production URL and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a random string generated with `openssl rand -base64 32`.

For OAuth providers, set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` from Google Cloud Console, and optionally `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` from GitHub. For Stripe, set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_BASIC_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`, and `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID`.

For Vercel Blob (auto-configured), set `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`. For app configuration, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`.

## Development Workflow

### Local Development

To run the application locally, first clone the repository and install dependencies with `pnpm install`. Set up your `.env.local` file with development credentials. Generate the Prisma client with `pnpm prisma:generate` and push the schema to your database with `pnpm prisma:push`. Start the development server with `pnpm dev` and open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Available Scripts

The project includes several useful scripts. Use `pnpm dev` to start the development server, `pnpm build` to build for production, `pnpm start` to start the production server, `pnpm lint` to run ESLint, `pnpm prisma:generate` to generate Prisma client, `pnpm prisma:migrate` to run migrations in development, `pnpm prisma:studio` to open Prisma Studio, and `pnpm prisma:push` to push schema to database.

### Testing Stripe Locally

To test Stripe webhooks locally, install the Stripe CLI, login with `stripe login`, forward webhooks with `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe`, copy the webhook secret to `.env.local`, and test with Stripe test cards.
