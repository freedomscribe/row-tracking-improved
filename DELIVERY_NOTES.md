Follow the **QUICK_START.md** guide for a 5-minute deployment to Vercel.

### Option 2: Detailed Setup
Follow the **DEPLOYMENT.md** guide for step-by-step instructions with explanations.

### Option 3: Local Development
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Set up `.env.local` with your credentials
3. Run database migrations: `pnpm prisma:push`
4. Start dev server: `pnpm dev`

## 🔑 What You Need to Set Up

### Required (Must Have)
1. **GitHub Account** - To host your code
2. **Vercel Account** - For deployment (free tier available)
3. **PostgreSQL Database** - Vercel Postgres or Supabase (free tier available)
4. **Google OAuth Credentials** - From Google Cloud Console (free)
5. **Stripe Account** - For payments (free, only pay transaction fees)

### Optional (Can Add Later)
- Custom domain name
- GitHub OAuth (in addition to Google)
- Monitoring tools (Sentry, Datadog)
- Email service (SendGrid, Resend)

## 💳 About Stripe (Payment Processing)

Since you asked about Stripe:

**What is Stripe?**
- Industry-standard payment processor (like PayPal but better for developers)
- Handles credit card processing securely
- Manages recurring subscriptions automatically
- No monthly fees, only 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction

**Why Stripe?**
- Most trusted and reliable
- Easiest to integrate
- Handles all payment security (PCI compliance)
- Automatic billing and invoicing
- Great documentation and support

**How it works:**
1. User signs in with Google (or email)
2. User clicks "Subscribe" on your pricing page
3. Stripe checkout page opens (secure, hosted by Stripe)
4. User enters payment info on Stripe's page (not yours - more secure!)
5. Stripe handles recurring billing automatically
6. Your app gets notified when subscription changes

**Cost Example:**
- User subscribes to Basic plan ($29/month)
- Stripe fee: $0.84 + $0.30 = $1.14
- You receive: $27.86
- Stripe handles everything automatically

## 📊 Subscription Tiers Explained

### Free Tier
- **Cost**: $0
- **Limits**: 2 projects, 50 parcels per project
- **Purpose**: Let users try the app
- **Good for**: Small contractors, testing

### Basic Tier ($29/month)

## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: Can I use this without Stripe?
**A:** Yes, but you'll need to remove subscription features. The app will work with just the Free tier functionality.

### Q: Can I self-host instead of Vercel?
**A:** Yes, you can deploy to any Node.js hosting (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.), but Vercel is easiest.

### Q: How do I import my existing data?
**A:** You can create a CSV import feature or use Prisma Studio to bulk import data.

### Q: Can I customize the features?
**A:** Absolutely! The code is well-organized and documented. You can add/remove features as needed.

### Q: What if I need help?
**A:** Check the documentation first, then:
