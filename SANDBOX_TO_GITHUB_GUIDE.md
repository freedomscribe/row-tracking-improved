# Complete Guide: From Sandbox to GitHub (Step-by-Step)

## ü§î What is the Sandbox?

The **sandbox** is a temporary virtual computer (like a cloud workspace) where I built your application. Think of it like this:

- **Sandbox** = Temporary workspace in the cloud (where I am right now)
- **Your Computer** = Your local machine (where you are)
- **GitHub** = Permanent storage for your code (online)

The files I created are currently **only in the sandbox**. We need to get them to **your computer**, then to **GitHub**.

## üìã Overview of the Process

Here's what we'll do:

```
Sandbox (temporary) ‚Üí Your Computer (local) ‚Üí GitHub (permanent)
     Step 1              Step 2                  Step 3
```

1. **Download** files from sandbox to your computer
2. **Set up Git** on your computer
3. **Create GitHub repository**
4. **Push** code to GitHub

Let's do this step by step!

## üéØ STEP 1: Download Files to Your Computer

### Option A: Download the ZIP File (Easiest)

1. **Download the ZIP file** I attached in my previous message
   - Look for `row-tracking-complete.zip` in the attachments
   - Click to download it
   - Save it to a folder you can find (like `Downloads` or `Desktop`)

2. **Extract the ZIP file**
   
   **On Windows:**
   - Right-click on `row-tracking-complete.zip`
   - Click "Extract All..."
   - Choose where to extract (like `C:\Users\YourName\Projects\`)
   - Click "Extract"

   **On Mac:**
   - Double-click `row-tracking-complete.zip`
   - It will automatically extract to the same folder

   **On Linux:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   unzip row-tracking-complete.zip
   mv row-tracking-improved ~/Projects/
   ```

3. **Verify the files are there**
   - Open the extracted folder `row-tracking-improved`
   - You should see folders like `src`, `prisma`, and files like `package.json`, `README.md`

## üéØ STEP 2: Set Up Git on Your Computer

### Check if Git is Already Installed

Open your terminal/command prompt and type:

```bash
git --version
```

**If you see something like:** `git version 2.x.x` ‚Üí Git is installed! Skip to Step 3.

**If you see an error:** ‚Üí You need to install Git first.

### Install Git (If Needed)

**On Windows:**
1. Go to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Download the installer
3. Run the installer (use default settings)
4. Restart your terminal/command prompt

**On Mac:**
1. Open Terminal
2. Type: `xcode-select --install`
3. Follow the prompts

**On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

### Configure Git (First Time Only)

Tell Git who you are:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace with your actual name and email (use the same email as your GitHub account).

---

## üéØ STEP 3: Create a GitHub Repository

### If You Don't Have a GitHub Account:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Follow the registration process
4. Verify your email

### Create a New Repository:

1. **Log in to GitHub**
   - Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Create a new repository**
   - Click the **"+"** icon in the top-right corner
   - Click **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in the repository details:**
   - **Repository name:** `row-tracking` (or whatever you want)
   - **Description:** "Right-of-Way Tracking Application"
   - **Visibility:** 
     - ‚úÖ **Private** (recommended - only you can see it)
     - or **Public** (anyone can see it)
   - **DO NOT** check "Initialize this repository with a README"
   - **DO NOT** add .gitignore or license yet (we already have them)

4. **Click "Create repository"**

5. **Copy the repository URL**
   - You'll see a page with setup instructions
   - Look for the URL that looks like:
     ```
     https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/row-tracking.git
     ```
   - **Copy this URL** - you'll need it in the next step!

---

## üéØ STEP 4: Push Your Code to GitHub

Now let's connect your local files to GitHub and upload them!

### Open Terminal/Command Prompt

**On Windows:**
- Press `Windows Key + R`
- Type `cmd` and press Enter
- OR use Git Bash (if you installed Git for Windows)

**On Mac:**
- Press `Command + Space`
- Type "Terminal" and press Enter

**On Linux:**
- Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

### Navigate to Your Project Folder

```bash
# Change directory to where you extracted the files
# Replace the path with your actual path

# Windows example:
cd C:\Users\YourName\Projects\row-tracking-improved

# Mac/Linux example:
cd ~/Projects/row-tracking-improved

# Verify you're in the right place:
ls
# You should see: src, prisma, package.json, etc.
```

### Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# This creates a hidden .git folder that tracks your changes
```

### Add All Files to Git

```bash
# Add all files to staging area
git add .

# The dot (.) means "add everything in this folder"
```

### Create Your First Commit

```bash
# Commit the files with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit: ROW Tracking application v2.0"

# The -m flag lets you add a message describing what you did
```

### Connect to GitHub

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username
# Replace row-tracking with your repository name if different

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/row-tracking.git

# Example:
# git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/row-tracking.git
```

### Rename the Branch to 'main'

```bash
# GitHub uses 'main' as the default branch name
git branch -M main
```

### Push Your Code to GitHub!

```bash
# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**You might be asked to log in:**
- Enter your GitHub username
- For password, use a **Personal Access Token** (not your GitHub password)

### Creating a Personal Access Token (If Needed)

If Git asks for a password and your GitHub password doesn't work:

1. Go to [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "ROW Tracking Git Access"
4. Select scopes: Check **"repo"** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **COPY THE TOKEN** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when Git asks

---

## ‚úÖ STEP 5: Verify Everything Worked

### Check GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/row-tracking
   ```

2. You should see all your files:
   - ‚úÖ `src/` folder
   - ‚úÖ `prisma/` folder
   - ‚úÖ `package.json`
   - ‚úÖ `README.md`
   - ‚úÖ And all other files!

3. Click on `README.md` to see the documentation

**üéâ SUCCESS! Your code is now on GitHub!**

---

## üîÑ Making Changes in the Future

When you want to update your code on GitHub:

```bash
# 1. Make your changes to the files
# 2. Check what changed
git status

# 3. Add the changed files
git add .

# 4. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Description of what you changed"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "git: command not found"
**Solution:** Git is not installed. Go back to Step 2 and install Git.

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"
**Solution:** Use HTTPS URL instead of SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/row-tracking.git
```

### Issue: "Failed to push some refs"
**Solution:** Pull first, then push:
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push origin main
```

### Issue: "Authentication failed"
**Solution:** Use a Personal Access Token instead of your password (see above).

### Issue: "fatal: not a git repository"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the right folder:
```bash
cd path/to/row-tracking-improved
git init
```

## ‚ùì Still Have Questions?

Common questions:

**Q: Can I edit files directly on GitHub?**
A: Yes, but it's better to edit locally and push changes.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**
A: Git keeps history! You can always go back to previous versions.

**Q: Should my repository be public or private?**
A: Private is safer for your business code. Public if you want to share it.

**Q: Do I need to pay for GitHub?**
A: No! Free accounts get unlimited private repositories.

**Q: What's the difference between Git and GitHub?**
A: Git = version control software (on your computer)
   GitHub = online service to store Git repositories (in the cloud)
